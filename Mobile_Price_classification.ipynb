        "The mobile phone industry is fiercely competitive, with companies constantly seeking ways to understand sales data and identify the factors that drive prices. This project aims to investigate the relationship between mobile phone features and their selling prices, focusing on establishing a price range rather than predicting exact prices.\n",
        "\n",
        "To accomplish this objective, a comprehensive dataset containing mobile phone sales records, including various features and corresponding prices, will be collected. Exploratory data analysis techniques will be employed to uncover trends, patterns, and correlations within the data. Statistical methods and domain knowledge will then be used to select the most influential features for further analysis.\n",
        "\n",
        "A predictive model or framework will be developed, utilizing machine learning algorithms or statistical methods, to estimate the price range based on the selected features. The performance of the model will be evaluated using appropriate metrics and cross-validation techniques to ensure its accuracy and reliability.\n",
        "\n",
        "The outcomes of this project will contribute to the mobile phone industry by identifying the key features that significantly impact the price range of mobile phones. This information will be invaluable for businesses operating in this sector, as it will enable them to optimize their pricing strategies and enhance their competitiveness in the market.\n",
        "\n",
        "The insights gained from this research will not only benefit mobile phone manufacturers but also provide valuable information to consumers. By understanding the relationship between features and prices, consumers can make more informed purchasing decisions based on their desired price range.\n",
        "\n",
        "Additionally, this project will contribute to the existing body of knowledge by adding empirical evidence on the relationship between mobile phone features and prices. It will shed light on the factors that influence pricing dynamics in the mobile phone market, furthering our understanding of this rapidly evolving industry.\n",
        "\n",
        "Ultimately, the project's findings and recommendations will help businesses in the mobile phone industry better align their products with market demands and consumer preferences. By optimizing their pricing strategies, manufacturers can enhance customer satisfaction and profitability.\n",
        "\n",
        "In conclusion, this project aims to explore the relationship between mobile phone features and price range. Through a comprehensive analysis of sales data and the development of a predictive model, it seeks to provide insights and recommendations to businesses operating in the mobile phone market. By understanding the factors that drive prices, companies can make informed decisions and adapt their strategies to meet consumer expectations. This research will contribute to the existing body of knowledge and support the continued growth and competitiveness of the mobile phone industry."

The objective is to determine a price range that indicates the relative pricing level, rather than predicting the exact price. This lack of understanding hinders companies' ability to optimize pricing strategies and may lead to mispriced products. Additionally, consumers face difficulty in making informed purchasing decisions. The project aims to uncover the key features that significantly impact price range variations and develop a model to estimate the price range based on these features. By addressing this problem, businesses can improve their competitiveness and consumers can make more informed decisions."

Standardization (Z-score normalization) is suitable for non-Gaussian data and algorithms that benefit from zero-mean features. Min-Max scaling is useful for bounding data within a specific range and preserving relative relationships between data points. Robust scaling is ideal for data with outliers as it is less affected by extreme values. It's recommended to experiment with different scaling methods and evaluate their impact on model performance to determine the most suitable one."

        "There are several evaluation metrics used in machine learning, each with its own indication towards business and impact. Here are some commonly used evaluation metrics and their business impact:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Accuracy**: Accuracy measures the proportion of correctly classified instances over the total number of instances. High accuracy indicates that the model is making correct predictions. However, accuracy alone may not be the best measure of model performance, especially when the classes are imbalanced. For example, if a model is used to predict fraudulent transactions, high accuracy may not be enough as it may still miss some fraudulent transactions.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Precision**: Precision is the proportion of true positives (correctly classified positive instances) over the total number of predicted positive instances. It indicates the model's ability to avoid false positives. High precision means that the model is making fewer false positive predictions. For example, in a medical diagnosis model, high precision means that the model is accurately predicting patients with a specific disease and not misdiagnosing healthy patients.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Recall**: Recall is the proportion of true positives over the total number of actual positive instances. It indicates the model's ability to detect positive instances. High recall means that the model is making fewer false negatives. For example, in a model to detect cancer, high recall means that the model is detecting most of the actual cancer cases and not missing them.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **F1-score**: F1-score is the harmonic mean of precision and recall. It combines both precision and recall and provides a more balanced evaluation of the model's performance. F1-score is a good measure when both precision and recall are important.\n",
        "\n",
        "The business impact of the ML model depends on the specific problem it is solving. For example, in a medical diagnosis model, high recall is crucial to ensure that no patients with the disease are missed, while high precision is also important to avoid false positives that could result in unnecessary treatments. In a fraud detection model, high precision is crucial to avoid flagging too many legitimate transactions as fraud, while high recall is also important to ensure that all fraudulent transactions are caught. Therefore, it is important to understand the specific business problem and select the appropriate evaluation metric(s) that align with the business goals."
